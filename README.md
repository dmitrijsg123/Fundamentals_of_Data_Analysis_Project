Simple Linear Regression Model using Python

The aim of the project is to build a Simple Linear Regression to study if there is a statistically important linear correllation between WIND SPEED and WIND TURBINE POWER OUTPUT. The goal is to accurately predict turbine power output from wind speed. The data can be used in the wind power industry to predict the necessary amount of wind power production.

Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a statistical technique which is used to find the linear relationship between dependent and one or more independent variables. It is applied for learning Regression problems where we can try and predict a continuous variable.

Linear Regression can be further classified into two types â€“ Simple and Multiple Linear Regression. In this project we employ Simple Linear Regression technique where we have one independent and one dependent variable. It is the simplest form of Linear Regression where we fit a straight line to the data.
